2. After installation, MetaMask will prompt you to either create a new wallet or import an existing one. If you're creating a new wallet, you’ll be asked to set a password. After that, you’ll get a seed phrase (12 words). Write this down and store it safely. This is the only way to recover your account if you lose access.
